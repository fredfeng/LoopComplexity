Overview</H2>
The program begins by reading in the .dot file, parsing it and mapping
it to an array representation called <I>board </I>of the switchbox to be
routed. For the homework example this array is given:

<P>A vector <I>pinnums </I>contains the number of unrouted pins remaining
for each net (i.e. at the beginning of the algorithm <I>pinnums</I>[1]
= 4, since net 1 has 4 pins to be routed). Another array <I>pinlist</I>
contains the locations of these pins with respect to the <I>board </I>array.

<P>Each pass of the algorithm proceeds as follows. A pin of net <I>n</I>
at position (<I>x1,y1</I>) is selected to route (this is done sequentially
- first a pin from net 1 is routed, then a pin from net 2, and so on).
Using a maze searching technique, the closest point belonging to net <I>n
</I>on the board<I>, </I>(<I>x2,y2</I>), is located. Clearly this will
find another pin at the beginning of the algorithm, but if two pins from
<I>n</I> have already been routed, anywhere along the wire between them
is acceptable as an output from the maze search. Now we consider the problem
of routing the pin at (<I>x1,y1</I>) towards (<I>x2,y2</I>). We treat this
as another search problem. Note that (<I>x2,y2</I>) is merely used to <I>direct</I>
the search - the final position we route may well be a different one, but
(<I>x2,y2</I>) is a good direction in which to aim.

<P>We start investigating a path beginning at (<I>x1,y1</I>). Our initial
direction is necessarily chosen to be perpendicular to the face of the
switchbox upon which we are starting. Our search is rule based, employing
simple heuristics to decide when to turn left and right, and bad moves
are recorded so that they are never repeated. A path will continue in a
straight line as long as doing so brings it closer to (<I>x2,y2</I>) or
it is blocked by a via from another net. In that sense the search is similar
to line based search, although many rules are incorporated to prevent paths
which may prove injurious to the routing of different nets later.

<P>The operation of the procedure to route (<I>x1,y1</I>) to (<I>x2,y2</I>)
is explained in the following pseudocode:

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Note the points in the above algorithm:</FONT>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">1: A straight move is forced if, in
turning, the resultant via would result in blocking another pin's entry

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">2: A 'good' move is regarded simply
as a move which brings the path closer to the solution. This simple definition
proved sufficient to route the example given.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">When a pin is routed it is removed dynamically

to be no need for a 'rip-up-and-reroute' facility. If such a facility were
necessary, it could be implemented by identifying which path is pivotal
in blocking the current path, deleting it and adding the de-routed pins

Data Structures</H2>
There are really only three important data structures involved in the switchbox
routing algorithm:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<I>board</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an array which represents the relevant
information about which moves are tabu during the routing of a pin. Each
position in the array maps trivially to a position in the switchbox. It
is initialized before each pin is routed. Values in the array denote the
positions of vias from other routed nets, positions where only horizontal
wiring is allowed (i.e. where a net has already been routed vertically)
and positions where only vertical wiring is allowed. Locations which correspond
to prerouted wires of the same net as the current pin are given special
marking as they correspond to valid end-points of the pin-routing procedure.</LI>

<LI>
<I>pinlist</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This contains a list of all the pins
to be routed, which is updated dynamically each time the pin-routing procedure
is called.</LI>

<LI>
<I>paths[]</I>:&nbsp; This is an array of linked lists, each linked list
representing the wiring of either a pin to another pin or a pin to its
corresponding net. Each list node in the linked list corresponds to a position
on the board, and is declared as follows:</LI>

<UL><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">public class listnode{</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int xpos, ypos;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// where on the circuit is it</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boolean up;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// up layer or down layer</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boolean block;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// does it block (is it a via)</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int net;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// what net does it correspond to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listnode link;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// next node on the list</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">}</FONT></UL>

Conclusion and Evaluation</H2>
<I>Why did you make these design decisions</I>:
<BR>In reality it was not very clear to me the purpose of the assignment;
whether it was to be an exercise in programming or an exercise in router
design. If the former, I would simply have found a paper on switchbox routing
and implemented the routines therein. I favored the latter idea as it would
give me a chance to investigate my own routing strategies. The router I
implemented is not very sophisticated but it does use sensible rules to
reach its goal. The decision not to support rip-up-and-reroute was purely
motivated by the fact that the example given did not require it, but I
would be happy to try to incorporate it in a later assignment.

<P><I>A short description of your experience with implementing the algorithm,
programming in Java, etc...:</I>
<BR>The homework assignment was, I felt, very long and I don't think this
was as clear to the TA as it proved to be for the students afterwards.
Not knowing Java before was, of course, a hindrance, and I really feel
a class devoted to the TA discussing (a) Java fundamentals, and (b) the
graph package we were supposed to use as our framework would have saved
everyone a great deal of time. Having said this I certainly learned quite
a bit of Java, but my code is sub-optimal - for the most part I tried to
treat Java as though it were C, thereby missing out on the advantageous
features which Java supports.

<P><I>Second assignment:</I>
<BR>The second assignment should be less lengthy, I feel. What I would
like to implement is an on-line router wherein the user may specify an
arbitrary pin configuration in a switchbox of arbitrary dimension. This
would really test our routing algorithms to the full.
