/**
 * An interface for a monitor object which cares about when graphs are edited,
 * and can monitor editing operations. The editor asks the monitor, <i>"Can I do
 * [operation]?"</i>
 * and the monitor returns a boolean value which can allow or disallow the
 * operation.
 * <p>
 *
 * Also, the functions are always called right before an operation is going to
 * be performed, so the monitor can invoke some changes in its internal state
 * which reflect the command if it answers in the affirmative.
 * <p>
 *
 * The interface is sort of clunky in that it contains so many functions, and
 * different entities within your application might want to answer different
 * questions and effect different state changes. The best way to do this is that
 * your implementation of GraphMonitor can just parsel out the work to one or
 * more other classes/objects.
